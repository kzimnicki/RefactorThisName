00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.330
For a long time,

2
00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.330
there was me, and my body.

3
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.330
Me was composed of stories,

4
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330
of cravings, of strivings,

5
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.330
of desires of the future.

6
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.330
Me was trying

7
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.330
not to be an outcome of my violent past,

8
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.330
but the separation that had already occurred

9
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.330
between me and my body

10
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.330
was a pretty significant outcome.

11
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.330
Me was always trying to become something, somebody.

12
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.330
Me only existed in the trying.

13
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.330
My body was often in the way.

14
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.330
Me was a floating head.

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.330
For years, I actually only wore hats.

16
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.330
It was a way of keeping my head attached.

17
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.330
It was a way of locating myself.

18
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.330
I worried that [if] I took my hat off

19
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.330
I wouldn't be here anymore.

20
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.330
I actually had a therapist who once said to me,

21
00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.330
"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,

22
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body."

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.330
All this time I lived in the city

24
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.330
because, to be honest,

25
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330
I was afraid of trees.

26
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.330
I never had babies

27
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.330
because heads cannot give birth.

28
00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.330
Babies actually don't come out of your mouth.

29
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
As I had no reference point for my body,

30
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.330
I began to ask other women about their bodies --

31
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.330
in particular, their vaginas,

32
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.330
because I thought vaginas were kind of important.

33
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.330
This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,"

34
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.330
which led to me obsessively and incessantly

35
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
talking about vaginas everywhere I could.

36
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.330
I did this in front of many strangers.

37
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.330
One night on stage,

38
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.330
I actually entered my vagina.

39
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
It was an ecstatic experience.

40
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.330
It scared me, it energized me,

41
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.330
and then I became a driven person,

42
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.330
a driven vagina.

43
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
I began to see my body like a thing,

44
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.330
a thing that could move fast,

45
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.330
like a thing that could accomplish other things,

46
00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.330
many things, all at once.

47
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.330
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.

48
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.330
I would drive it and demand things from it.

49
00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.330
It had no limits. It was invincible.

50
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.330
It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.

51
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.330
I didn't heed it;

52
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330
no, I organized it and I directed it.

53
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.330
I didn't have patience for my body;

54
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330
I snapped it into shape.

55
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.330
I was greedy.

56
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.330
I took more than my body had to offer.

57
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.330
If I was tired, I drank more espressos.

58
00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.330
If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places.

59
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.330
Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,

60
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.330
the way an abusive parent

61
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330
can sometimes have a moment of kindness.

62
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
My father was really kind to me

63
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.330
on my 16th birthday, for example.

64
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.330
I heard people murmur from time to time

65
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.330
that I should love my body,

66
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.330
so I learned how to do this.

67
00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.330
I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.

68
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.330
But all that was just a more sophisticated way

69
00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.330
to manipulate my body --

70
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.330
a further disassociation,

71
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.330
like planting a vegetable field on a freeway.

72
00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:14.330
As a result of me talking so much about my vagina,

73
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:17.330
many women started to tell me about theirs --

74
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.330
their stories about their bodies.

75
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.330
Actually, these stories compelled me around the world,

76
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.330
and I've been to over 60 countries.

77
00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.330
I heard thousands of stories,

78
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.330
and I have to tell you, there was always this moment

79
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.330
where the women shared with me

80
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
that particular moment when she separated from her body --

81
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.330
when she left home.

82
00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
I heard about women being molested in their beds,

83
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:42.330
flogged in their burqas,

84
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.330
left for dead in parking lots,

85
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.330
acid burned in their kitchens.

86
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
Some women became quiet and disappeared.

87
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.330
Other women became mad, driven machines like me.

88
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.330
In the middle of my traveling,

89
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.330
I turned 40 and I began to hate my body,

90
00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.330
which was actually progress,

91
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.330
because at least my body existed enough to hate it.

92
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.

93
00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.330
It was proof that I had not measured up,

94
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.330
that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect

95
00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.330
or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.

96
00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.330
My stomach was proof that I had failed,

97
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.330
that it had failed me, that it was broken.

98
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.330
My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.

99
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330
In fact, it became so extreme

100
00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.330
I wrote a play about it.

101
00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.330
But the more I talked about it,

102
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.330
the more objectified and fragmented my body became.

103
00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.330
It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,

104
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.330
something I was selling.

105
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.330
Then I went somewhere else.

106
00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.330
I went outside

107
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.330
what I thought I knew.

108
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.330
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.

109
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.330
And I heard stories

110
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.330
that shattered all the other stories.

111
00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.330
I heard stories

112
00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.330
that got inside my body.

113
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:59.330
I heard about a little girl

114
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.330
who couldn't stop peeing on herself

115
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.330
because so many grown soldiers

116
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.330
had shoved themselves inside her.

117
00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.330
I heard an 80-year-old woman

118
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.330
whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets

119
00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.330
and twisted up on her head

120
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.330
as the soldiers raped her like that.

121
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.330
There are thousands of these stories,

122
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.330
and many of the women had holes in their bodies --

123
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.330
holes, fistula --

124
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.330
that were the violation of war --

125
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:28.330
holes in the fabric of their souls.

126
00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.330
These stories saturated my cells and nerves,

127
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.330
and to be honest,

128
00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.330
I stopped sleeping for three years.

129
00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.330
All the stories began to bleed together.

130
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.330
The raping of the Earth,

131
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.330
the pillaging of minerals,

132
00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.330
the destruction of vaginas --

133
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.330
none of these were separate anymore

134
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.330
from each other or me.

135
00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:52.330
Militias were raping six-month-old babies

136
00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.330
so that countries far away

137
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.330
could get access to gold and coltan

138
00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.330
for their iPhones and computers.

139
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.330
My body had not only become a driven machine,

140
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.330
but it was responsible now

141
00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
for destroying other women's bodies

142
00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.330
in its mad quest to make more machines

143
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.330
to support the speed and efficiency of my machine.

144
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.330
Then I got cancer --

145
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.330
or I found out I had cancer.

146
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.330
It arrived like a speeding bird

147
00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.330
smashing into a windowpane.

148
00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.330
Suddenly, I had a body,

149
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.330
a body that was pricked

150
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:27.330
and poked and punctured,

151
00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.330
a body that was cut wide open,

152
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:32.330
a body that had organs removed

153
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:35.330
and transported and rearranged and reconstructed,

154
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.330
a body that was scanned

155
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.330
and had tubes shoved down it,

156
00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:42.330
a body that was burning from chemicals.

157
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.330
Cancer exploded

158
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.330
the wall of my disconnection.

159
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body

160
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.330
was the crisis in the world,

161
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.330
and it wasn't happening later,

162
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.330
it was happening now.

163
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,

164
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.330
the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,

165
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.330
the cancer that gets inside people

166
00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.330
who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor --

167
00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.330
the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,

168
00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.330
the cancer of stress for not achieving enough,

169
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.330
the cancer of buried trauma,

170
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.330
the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,

171
00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:21.330
the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,

172
00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.330
the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness.

173
00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.330
In his new and visionary book,

174
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.330
"New Self, New World,"

175
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:31.330
the writer Philip Shepherd says,

176
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.330
"If you are divided from your body,

177
00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:37.330
you are also divided from the body of the world,

178
00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.330
which then appears to be other than you

179
00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.330
or separate from you,

180
00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:43.330
rather than the living continuum

181
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:45.330
to which you belong."

182
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:47.330
Before cancer,

183
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:49.330
the world was something other.

184
00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.330
It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool

185
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:54.330
and cancer dynamited the boulder

186
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:57.330
that was separating me from the larger sea.

187
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.330
Now I am swimming in it.

188
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.330
Now I lay down in the grass

189
00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.330
and I rub my body in it,

190
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.330
and I love the mud on my legs and feet.

191
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.330
Now I make a daily pilgrimage

192
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:13.330
to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,

193
00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.330
and I hunger for the green fields

194
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.330
in the bush outside Bukavu.

195
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.330
And when it rains hard rain,

196
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:22.330
I scream and I run in circles.

197
00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:26.330
I know that everything is connected,

198
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:29.330
and the scar that runs the length of my torso

199
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:31.330
is the markings of the earthquake.

200
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:35.330
And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.

201
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.330
And the fire that burned in me

202
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.330
on day three through six of chemo

203
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.330
is the fire that is burning

204
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.330
in the forests of the world.

205
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.330
I know that the abscess

206
00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:49.330
that grew around my wound after the operation,

207
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:51.330
the 16 ounces of puss,

208
00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.330
is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,

209
00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.330
and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me

210
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.330
and dead floating fish.

211
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:02.330
And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication

212
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.330
made me scream out

213
00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:08.330
the way the Earth cries out from the drilling.

214
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.330
In my second chemo,

215
00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:12.330
my mother got very sick

216
00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.330
and I went to see her.

217
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.330
And in the name of connectedness,

218
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.330
the only thing she wanted before she died

219
00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.330
was to be brought home

220
00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:24.330
by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.

221
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.330
So we brought her home,

222
00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:28.330
and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach

223
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.330
before she died.

224
00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.330
And gratefully, it didn't.

225
00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.330
And she died quietly in her favorite place.

226
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.330
And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,

227
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.330
and this beautiful, spiritual friend

228
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.330
told me she wanted to do a healing for me.

229
00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.330
And I was honored.

230
00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:45.330
And I went to her house, and it was morning,

231
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.330
and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.

232
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:50.330
And my friend was preparing this big bowl,

233
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.330
and I said, "What is it?"

234
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:54.330
And she said, "It's for you.

235
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.330
The flowers make it beautiful,

236
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.330
and the honey makes it sweet."

237
00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.330
And I said, "But what's the water part?"

238
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.330
And in the name of connectedness,

239
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:06.330
she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico."

240
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.330
And I said, "Of course it is."

241
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.330
And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,

242
00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.330
and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.

243
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:16.330
And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.

244
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:18.330
And the other women sang

245
00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.330
and they prayed for me and my mother.

246
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:23.330
And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,

247
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:25.330
I realized that it held

248
00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.330
the best and the worst of us.

249
00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.330
It was the greed and recklessness

250
00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:33.330
that led to the drilling explosion.

251
00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.330
It was all the lies that got told

252
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:37.330
before and after.

253
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.330
It was the honey in the water that made it sweet,

254
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:42.330
it was the oil that made it sick.

255
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.330
It was my head that was bald --

256
00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
and comfortable now without a hat.

257
00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:48.330
It was my whole self

258
00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:50.330
melting into Michaela's lap.

259
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf

260
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.330
that were falling down my cheek.

261
00:10:55.330 --> 00:11:00.330
It was finally being in my body.

262
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.330
It was the sorrow

263
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.330
that's taken so long.

264
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:06.330
It was finding my place

265
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:08.330
and the huge responsibility

266
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.330
that comes with connection.

267
00:11:10.330 --> 00:11:13.330
It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo

268
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:15.330
and the indifference of the world.

269
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:17.330
It was the Congolese women

270
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:19.330
who are now rising up.

271
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.330
It was my mother leaving,

272
00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.330
just at the moment

273
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:25.330
that I was being born.

274
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:27.330
It was the realization

275
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.330
that I had come very close to dying --

276
00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:32.330
in the same way that the Earth, our mother,

277
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.330
is barely holding on,

278
00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:39.330
in the same way that 75 percent of the planet

279
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.330
are hardly scraping by,

280
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.330
in the same way

281
00:11:44.330 --> 00:11:47.330
that there is a recipe for survival.

282
00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.330
What I learned

283
00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:52.330
is it has to do with attention and resources

284
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.330
that everybody deserves.

285
00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.330
It was advocating friends

286
00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:58.330
and a doting sister.

287
00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.330
It was wise doctors and advanced medicine

288
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:03.330
and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.

289
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:07.330
It was underpaid and really loving nurses.

290
00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.330
It was magic healers and aromatic oils.

291
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.330
It was people who came with spells and rituals.

292
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.330
It was having a vision of the future

293
00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:17.330
and something to fight for,

294
00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:20.330
because I know this struggle isn't my own.

295
00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.330
It was a million prayers.

296
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:24.330
It was a thousand hallelujahs

297
00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.330
and a million oms.

298
00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.330
It was a lot of anger,

299
00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.330
insane humor,

300
00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.330
a lot of attention, outrage.

301
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.330
It was energy, love and joy.

302
00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:37.330
It was all these things.

303
00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.330
It was all these things.

304
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
It was all these things

305
00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.330
in the water, in the world, in my body.

306
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:52.330
(Applause)
